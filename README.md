# Face Mesh Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This repository features a Python application that leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform detailed face mesh detection on video files.

## Description

The script processes video input to detect facial landmarks with high accuracy. It visualizes these landmarks as a mesh overlay on the faces in the video.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless mediapipe
```
## Usage
```
python face_mesh_detection.py
```
## Output
Detection of multiple faces in a video.
Real-time overlay of facial landmarks.
Display of FPS to assess performance.
